# SociaShame for x86 Linux

Support for 32 bit Linux systems will not be available due to the age of 32 bit dawning upon us, and the threat of the [Y2K38 bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem)

The following architectures will be dropped:

all 32 and 16 bit architectures, such as i386, i486, i586, i686, etc.

If you still have any 32 bit Linux systems that you depend on, make sure to upgrade to a 64 bit version by 3:14:07 am (UTC) on January 19th 2038.
